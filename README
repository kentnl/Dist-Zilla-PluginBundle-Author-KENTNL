NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL - BeLike::KENTNL when you
    build your distributions.

VERSION
    version 2.014002

SYNOPSIS
        [@Author::KENTNL]
        git_versions = 1      ; Mandatory flag indicating the dist is adjusted to use git tag versioning
                              ; otherwise use an older bundle version.

        normal_form  = numify ; Mandatory for this bundle indicating normal form.
                              ; see DZP::Git::NextVersion::Sanitized

        mantissa     = 6      ; Mandatory for this bundle if normal_form is numify.
                              ; see DZP::Git::NextVersion::Sanitized

        authority    = cpan:KENTNL ; Optional, defaults to cpan:KENTNL

        auto_prereqs_skip   = Some::Module  ; Hide these from autoprereqs
        auto_prereqs_skip   = Other::Module

        toolkit     = mb   ; Which toolkit to use. Either eumm or mb
                             ; mb is default.

        toolkit_hardness = hard ; Whether to upgrade *require* deps to the latest
                                ; or wether to make them merely recomendations.
                                ; Either 'soft' ( recommend ) or 'hard' ( require )
                                ; default is 'hard'

        twitter_extra_hash_tags = #foo #bar ; non-default hashtags to append to the tweet

DESCRIPTION
    This is the plug-in bundle that KENTNL uses. It exists mostly because he
    is very lazy and wants others to be using what he's using if they want
    to be doing work on his modules.

NAMING SCHEME
    As I blogged about on "blog.fox.geek.nz" : Making a Minting Profile as a
    CPANized Dist <http://bit.ly/hAwl4S>, this bundle advocates a new naming
    system for people who are absolutely convinced they want their
    "Author-Centric" distribution uploaded to CPAN.

    As we have seen with Dist::Zilla there have been a slew of PluginBundles
    with CPANID's in their name, to the point that there is a copious amount
    of name-space pollution in the PluginBundle name-space, and more Author
    bundles than task-bundles, which was really what the name-space was
    designed for, and I'm petitioning you to help reduce this annoyance in
    future modules.

    From a CPAN testers perspective, the annoyance of lots of CPANID-dists
    is similar to the annoyance of the whole DPCHRIST:: subspace, and that
    if this pattern continues, it will mean for the testers who do not wish
    to test everyones personal modules, that they will have to work hard to
    avoid this. If DPCHRIST:: had used something like Author::DPCHRIST::
    instead, I doubt so many people would be horrified by it, because you
    can just have a policy/rule that excludes ^Author::, and everyone else
    who goes that way can be quietly ignored.

    Then we could probably rationally add that same restriction to the irc
    announce bots, the "recent modules" list and so-forth, and possibly even
    apply special indexing restrictions or something so people wouldn't even
    have to know those modules exist on cpan!

    So, for the sake of cleanliness, semantics, and general global sanity, I
    ask you to join me with my Author:: naming policy to voluntarily
    segregate modules that are most likely of only personal use from those
    that have more general application.

        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Foo                    # [Foo]                 dist-zilla plugins for general use
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::KENTNL::Foo    # [Author::KENTNL::Foo] foo that only KENTNL will probably have use for
        Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Classic          # [@Classic]            A bundle that can have practical use by many
        Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL   # [@Author::KENTNL]     KENTNL's primary plugin bundle
        Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::Default        # A minting profile that is used by all
        Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::Author::KENTNL # A minting profile that only KENTNL will find of use.

  Current Proponents
    I wish to give proper respect to the people out there already
    implementing this scheme:

    @Author::DOHERTY - Mike Doherty's, Author Bundle.
    @Author::OLIVER - Oliver Gorwits', Author Bundle.
    "Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::" namespace <http://bit.ly/dIovQI> -
    Oliver Gorwit's blog on the subject.
    @Author::LESPEA - Adam Lesperance's, Author Bundle.
    @Author::ALEXBIO - Alessandro Ghedini's, Author Bundle.
    @Author::RWSTAUNER - Randy Stauner's, Author Bundle.
    @Author::WOLVERIAN - Ilmari Vacklin's, Author Bundle.

    @Author::RUSSOZ - Alexei Znamensky's, Author Bundle.

METHODS
  "bundle_config"
    See the "PluginBundle" role for what this is for, it is a method to
    satisfy that role.

  "add_plugin"
        $bundle_object->add_plugin("Basename" => { config_hash } );

  "add_named_plugin"
        $bundle_object->add_named_plugin("alias" => "Basename" => { config_hash } );

  "configure"
    Called by in "bundle_config" after "new"

ATTRIBUTES
  "plugins"
    INTERNAL.

      ArrayRef, ro, default = [], no init arg.

    Populated during "$self->configure" and returned from "->bundle_config"

  "normal_form"
      Str, ro, required

    A "normal_form" to pass to "[Git::NextVersion::Sanitized]".

    See "[::Role::Version::Sanitize]"

  "mantissa"
      Int, ro, required if normal_form eq 'numify'

    Defines the length of the mantissa when normal form is "numify".

    See "[Git::NextVersion::Sanitized]" and "[::Role::Version::Sanitize]"

  "git_versions"
      enum([1]), ro, required

    *   MUST BE SPECIFIED

    *   MUST BE 1

    Setting as such indicates that the distribution in question is safe to
    use with "Git::NextVersion".

    As no logic exists any more to support using anything other than
    "Git::NextVersion" with this bundle, this parameter must be turned on
    and you must use Git::NextVersion.

  "authority"
      Str, ro, default = cpan:KENTNL

    An authority string to use for "[Authority]".

  "auto_prereqs_skip"
      ArrayRef, ro, multivalue, default = []

    A list of prerequisites to pass to "[AutoPrereqs].skips"

  "twitter_extra_hash_tags"
      Str, ro, default = ""

    Additional hash tags to append to twitter

  "twitter_hash_tags"
      Str, ro, default = '#perl #cpan' . extras()

    Populates "extras" from "twitter_extra_hash_tags"

  "tweet_url"
      Str, ro, default =  q[https://metacpan.org/release/{{$AUTHOR_UC}}/{{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}}{{$TRIAL}}#whatsnew]

    The "URI" to tweet to @kentnlrelease

  "toolkit_hardness"
      enum( hard, soft ), ro, default = hard

    *   "hard"

        Copy the versions of important toolkit components the author was
        using as "required" dependencies, forcing consumers to update
        aggressively on those parts.

    *   "soft"

        Copy the versions of important toolkit components the author was
        using as "recommended" dependencies, so that only consumers who are
        installing with "--with-recommended" get given the forced upgrade
        path.

  "toolkit"
      enum( mb, mbtiny, eumm ), ro, default = mb

    Determines which tooling to generate the distribution with

    *   "mb" : "Module::Build"

    *   "mbtiny" : "Module::Build::Tiny"

    *   "eumm" : "ExtUtils::MakeMaker"

  "bumpversions"
      bumpversions = 1

    If true, use "[BumpVersionAfterRelease]" and
    "[RewriteVersions::Sanitized]" instead of "[PkgVersion]" and
    "[Git::NextVersion::Sanitized]"
